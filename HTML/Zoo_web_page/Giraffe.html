    <center><h1>Giraffe</h1></center>
    <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial
        animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest
        extant relative, the okapi. Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis,
        with nine subspecies. Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species which can be
        distinguished by their fur coat patterns. Six valid extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

        The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and
        spotted coat patterns. Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from
        Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is
        leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other
        ground-based herbivores cannot reach. Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon
        giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult
        males but are gregarious and may gather in large groups. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking",
        combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole
        responsibility for rearing the young.

        The giraffe has intrigued various ancient and modern cultures for its peculiar appearance and has often been
        featured in paintings, books, and cartoons. It is classified by the International Union for Conservation of
        Nature (IUCN) as vulnerable to extinction. It has been extirpated from many parts of its former range. Giraffes
        are still found in many national parks and game reserves, but estimates as of 2016 indicate there are
        approximately 97,500 members of Giraffa in the wild. More than 1,600 were kept in zoos in 2010.</p>
